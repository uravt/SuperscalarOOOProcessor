# Prerequisites and description
The prerequisites and description of tasks are in the document on Piazza. Use this to set up your machine with the required cross compilers and tools necessary.

# Prepare test program to simulate
`mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc -mips32 <path-to-benchmark-source> -nostartfiles -Ttext=0 -o <path-to-benchmark-executable>`

# Build the simulator
`make clean; make`

# Run the simulator
`./processor --bmk=<path-to-benchmark-executable> -O<opt-level> > log`

```plaintext
# The output log contains the state of the register file printed at every cycle,
# along with the overall time spent (in microseconds) executing the benchmark.
# We look for functional correctness as well as the performance in our evaluation.
#
# Example:
# 
# CYCLE X
# R[0]: 0
# R[1]: 0
# R[2]: 5278
